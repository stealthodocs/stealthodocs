# Executing Your First Swap

Ready to trade? Here’s the step-by-step:

1. **Select Assets:** Choose the token you’re swapping (e.g., BTC) and the one you want (e.g., ETH). Stealtho’s multi-chain support makes this flexible.
2. **Pick a Rate:** Opt for fixed rates for predictability or floating rates for market play. The real-time rate engine shows you the latest prices upfront.
3. **Review Fees:** Check the transparent fee breakdown—no hidden costs. For Bitcoin swaps, Lightning Network keeps fees tiny.
4. **Confirm:** Hit “Swap,” approve the transaction in your wallet, and watch it process. Most swaps finish in seconds; Lightning trades are near-instant.
5. **Verify:** Check your wallet to ensure the new tokens arrived. Done!

**Security Tip:** Start with a small test swap to get comfortable. Never approve transactions from unknown sources—Stealtho’s smart contracts are audited, but your diligence matters.
