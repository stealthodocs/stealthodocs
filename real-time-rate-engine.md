# Real-Time Rate Engine

Stealtho’s real-time rate engine is the brain behind our pricing. It pulls data from multiple liquidity pools—think decentralized exchanges, market makers, and on-chain sources—aggregating it into a single, dynamic feed. Whether you choose fixed rates for stability or floating rates for speculation, the engine ensures you get the best deal available at that moment.

This isn’t a static snapshot. The system updates in real time, adjusting to market shifts with millisecond precision. During a Bitcoin rally or an Ethereum dip, the engine recalibrates instantly, offering rates that reflect the latest conditions. It’s like having a personal arbitrage bot baked into the platform—without the complexity.

**Security ties** in here too. By sourcing from diverse pools, we avoid over-reliance on any single provider, reducing manipulation risks. Transparent rate displays let you verify the math before confirming. It’s power and peace of mind, rolled into one.
