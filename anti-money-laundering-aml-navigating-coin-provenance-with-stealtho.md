# Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Navigating Coin Provenance with Stealtho

Stealtho is a mixer at its core, designed to enhance privacy by breaking traceable links between transactions. Our AML approach aligns with this ethos: we don’t block or seize funds based on their provenance, but we provide optional checks to help you assess risks and take control. Here’s how it works:

- **Optional AML Scans:** When initiating a swap, you can opt into our AML check, which uses advanced blockchain analytics to evaluate your coins’ transaction history. The scan flags connections to high-risk addresses—say, a wallet tied to a known scam—generating a risk score (low, medium, high).
- **Transparent Alerts:** If the scan indicates a high likelihood of "tainted" coins (e.g., “These funds have a 70% risk score due to a link with a blacklisted mixer”), we notify you before the swap proceeds. The alert is clear, jargon-free, and includes the risk level and its source.
- **Recommendations for Cleaning:** For high-risk coins, Stealtho recommends using our mixing service to "clean" them. As a mixer, Stealtho obfuscates transaction trails by pooling and redistributing funds, effectively breaking links to risky addresses. For example, if you’re swapping BTC flagged for a prior hack, we suggest routing it through our mixer to output "clean" BTC, reducing its risk profile for use on other platforms. You can adjust the mixing depth (e.g., number of hops) for stronger privacy, though we note that deeper mixing may increase fees or processing time.
- **User Autonomy:** The choice is yours—proceed with the swap as-is, follow our cleaning recommendation, or cancel. Since Stealtho is non-custodial, we never hold or freeze your funds, preserving your control. Our role is to inform, not enforce.

## Balancing Privacy and Practicality

Stealtho’s AML checks are built to protect your freedom while addressing real-world challenges. They’re:
- **Privacy-Preserving:** No personal data is collected—only wallet addresses and transaction metadata are analyzed, keeping you pseudonymous.
- **Optional:** Skip the AML scan if you prioritize speed or privacy, though we recommend it for high-value swaps to avoid issues elsewhere.
- **Transparent:** Risk scores and cleaning suggestions are clearly explained, empowering you to make informed decisions.

This approach reflects our security-first mindset. By flagging high-risk coins and offering a built-in solution—our mixing service—we help you navigate the ecosystem without running afoul of stricter platforms (e.g., centralized exchanges or DeFi protocols). It’s about keeping your trades fluid and future-proof.

## Why This Matters for Stealtho Users

In March 2025, AML compliance is a growing hurdle. Centralized services increasingly reject tainted coins, and even DeFi platforms may flag risky funds. Stealtho’s AML checks let you stay ahead, identifying potential issues before they disrupt your plans. For a student swapping $20 of BTC for SOL, it’s a safeguard against unknowingly handling risky coins. For a pro moving thousands across chains, it’s a tool to ensure assets remain usable. By leveraging Stealtho’s mixing capabilities, you can clean high-risk coins seamlessly, maintaining privacy and control in a regulated world.
