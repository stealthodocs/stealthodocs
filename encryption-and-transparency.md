# Encryption and Transparency

Every transaction on Stealtho is fortified by top-tier encryption, safeguarding your data and assets from interception or tampering. We employ industry-standard protocols—think AES-256 and TLS 1.3—to create an impenetrable shield around your interactions. Whether it’s your wallet address, transaction details, or personal metadata, everything is locked down tight.

Transparency is just as vital. Hidden fees and murky processes erode trust, so we’ve made clarity a cornerstone of Stealtho. Before you confirm a swap, you see the exact fees upfront—no surprises, no bait-and-switch. This openness extends to our security practices: we’re upfront about how we protect you, because trust isn’t built in the shadows.
