# Smart Contracts

Cross-chain swaps are the lifeblood of Stealtho, and they’re powered by smart contracts. These self-executing agreements, written in battle-tested code, eliminate the need for intermediaries. When you initiate a swap—say, Ethereum for Solana—the smart contract locks the terms, verifies the conditions, and releases the assets once fulfilled. It’s trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof.

Security is paramount here. Our smart contracts undergo exhaustive audits by independent blockchain security firms, rooting out vulnerabilities before they’re deployed. We also use formal verification techniques—mathematical proofs that ensure the code behaves as intended. This rigorous approach minimizes risks like reentrancy attacks or logic flaws, which have plagued lesser platforms.

For you, smart contracts mean confidence. You’re not relying on a middleman who could fail or fleece you—you’re interacting directly with code that’s been hardened against failure. It’s blockchain’s promise delivered: control and certainty in every trade.
