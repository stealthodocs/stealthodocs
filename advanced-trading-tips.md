# Advanced Trading Tips

For seasoned users, Stealtho offers deeper control:

- **Timing the Market:** Use floating rates during uptrends to maximize gains, or fixed rates in downturns to lock in value. Monitor market signals (e.g., via X posts or on-chain data) to inform your choice.
- **Cross-Chain Arbitrage:** Spot price differences across chains—like Solana vs. Avalanche—and swap to profit. Stealtho’s speed and liquidity make this viable.
- **Batch Trades:** Plan multiple swaps to diversify or rebalance, leveraging our low-latency engine to execute quickly.

**Security Tip:** Use a hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger) for large trades, and audit your transaction history regularly for anomalies.
