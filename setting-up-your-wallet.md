# Setting Up Your Wallet

Before you trade, you’ll need a compatible wallet—Stealtho’s non-custodial nature means your assets stay under your control. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Choose a Wallet:** Popular options include MetaMask (Ethereum and EVM chains), Trust Wallet (multi-chain), or a Bitcoin wallet with Lightning support (e.g., Muun or Phoenix). Pick one that suits your chains of choice.
2. **Secure Your Keys:** Generate your wallet and back up your seed phrase—12 or 24 words that unlock your funds. Write it down, store it offline (e.g., on paper or a metal plate), and never share it. This is your first line of defense.
3. **Fund Your Wallet:** Transfer crypto to your wallet address from another exchange, a friend, or a hardware device. Double-check the address—blockchain transactions are irreversible.
4. **Connect to Stealtho:** Visit the Stealtho app, click “Connect Wallet,” and approve the link. No KYC, no signup—just your wallet and our platform.

**Security Tip:** Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if your wallet supports it, and beware of phishing sites mimicking Stealtho. Always verify the URL (e.g., stealtho.io) before connecting.
