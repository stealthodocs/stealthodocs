# Lightning Network Integration

For Bitcoin swaps, Stealtho harnesses the Lightning Network, a second-layer scaling solution that’s as secure as it is swift. Traditional Bitcoin transactions, while robust, can be slow and costly during peak times. The Lightning Network changes that, enabling near-instant swaps with minimal fees—all while preserving Bitcoin’s legendary security.

How does it work? Transactions occur off-chain in a peer-to-peer channel, only settling on the Bitcoin blockchain when necessary. This reduces congestion, cuts costs, and maintains the cryptographic integrity that makes Bitcoin a gold standard. For you, it means Bitcoin swaps that are fast, affordable, and ironclad—security and efficiency in perfect harmony.
