# Distributed Systems

At the core of Stealtho is a distributed system built to handle the demands of a global, 24/7 crypto market. Unlike centralized platforms that rely on a single server—or a handful of them—our infrastructure is spread across multiple nodes worldwide. This decentralization enhances reliability: if one node goes down, others pick up the slack, ensuring uninterrupted service.

This design also boosts performance. By processing transactions closer to users geographically, we minimize latency—a critical edge when seconds can sway a trade. But the real win is security. A distributed system has no central point of failure, making it exponentially harder for attackers to compromise. Paired with encryption and real-time monitoring, this architecture forms a resilient shield against downtime and threats.

For users, this means a platform that’s always on, always fast, and always safe. Whether you’re swapping tokens at midnight or during a market frenzy, Stealtho’s distributed backbone keeps the engine humming.
