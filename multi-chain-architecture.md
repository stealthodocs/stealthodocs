# Multi-Chain Architecture

The crypto ecosystem isn’t one-size-fits-all, and neither is Stealtho. Our multi-chain architecture supports a growing roster of blockchains—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and beyond. This isn’t just about compatibility; it’s about flexibility. Each chain has unique strengths—Bitcoin’s security, Solana’s speed, Ethereum’s DeFi depth—and Stealtho lets you tap into them all.

Integration is seamless. Smart contracts bridge the gaps, while our UI abstracts the complexity. Want to swap BTC for SOL? The Lightning Network handles Bitcoin’s leg, Solana’s high-throughput chain takes the other, and you get a fast, secure result. This architecture scales with the market, ready for new chains as they emerge.

For users, it’s freedom. You’re not locked into one ecosystem—you can move assets wherever opportunity lies, with Stealtho as your multi-lane highway.
