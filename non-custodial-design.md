# Non-Custodial Design

At the heart of Stealtho’s security model is its non-custodial architecture. Unlike centralized exchanges that hold your funds in their wallets—leaving them vulnerable to hacks, insider theft, or mismanagement—Stealtho never takes custody of your assets. Your tokens stay in your wallet, under your private keys, and move directly to their destination during a swap. We’re merely the conduit, facilitating the transaction without ever touching your funds.

This approach eliminates a major risk vector. Centralized platforms have historically been prime targets for attackers—billions have been lost to breaches over the years. By keeping your assets in your control, Stealtho sidesteps this entirely. No custodial honeypot, no single point of failure. Your keys, your crypto—it’s that simple.

But non-custodial doesn’t mean hands-off. We’ve engineered a seamless process where you retain sovereignty without sacrificing usability. Connect your wallet, approve the swap, and watch it execute securely. It’s empowerment without complexity, ensuring you’re always the master of your financial destiny.
